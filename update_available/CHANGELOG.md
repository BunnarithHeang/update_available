## 2.0.0-nullsafety

- Migration to *null-safety*
- Changed `version` to `pub_semver`

**Disclaimer:** I think that it's correctly working, but as I am not using *null-safety* in production yet, I couldn't propertly test it. I am going to ask to someone to test it for me and, as soon it's safe to be used in production, I publish it as stable.
